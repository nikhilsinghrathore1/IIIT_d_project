these are three seperate projects 
open the 3d_university folder 
npm install 
npm run dev 

open the landing_page
npm install 
npm run dev 

open the test_taking_app
npm install 
npm run dev


all these are running on different tabs but all are running locally all the code is in this repo but it is not all as the file was very big github won't allow to upload so i have give the remaining code in the zip file so merge the zip file and github repo to get the full code
